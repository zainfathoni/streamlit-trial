# 🧠 → 💬 → 🐍 Chat Dashboard Demo

A live coding demonstration for the talk **"Think in JS, Code in Python — with AI"**

## About

This is a **Streamlit chat dashboard** built using React mental models translated to Python. It demonstrates how AI can bridge the gap between JavaScript-style thinking and Python code generation.

**For the talk (5-10 min):**
- Start with `app.py`
- Show progressive versions: `app_v1_basic.py` → `app_v2_timestamps.py` → `app_v3_styled.py`
- Use Claude Code (me) to assist with live modifications

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Demo

```bash
# Option A: Live coding starting point
streamlit run app.py

# Option B: View a completed version
streamlit run app_v1_basic.py       # Step 1: Basic
streamlit run app_v2_timestamps.py  # Step 2: With timestamps
streamlit run app_v3_styled.py      # Step 3: Styled bubbles
```

## Demo Structure

### Step 1: Basic Chat Dashboard (`app_v1_basic.py`)
**Duration:** ~2–3 minutes

🎯 **What you'll demonstrate:**
- State management using `st.session_state` (like React's `useState`)
- Rendering messages in a list
- Input box with send button
- Restart/rerun behavior (Streamlit's equivalent to React re-renders)

💬 **Talk point:**
> "This is how a React dev thinks: header, list, input. In Python, it's still the same structure—just using Streamlit instead of JSX."

---

### Step 2: Add Timestamps (`app_v2_timestamps.py`)
**Duration:** ~2–3 minutes

🎯 **What you'll demonstrate:**
- Store structured data (dicts in session state, like useState with objects)
- Derive rendering with `reversed()` (like React's `useMemo` or derived state)
- Add temporal info with `datetime`

💬 **Talk point:**
> "We just enriched our state structure. React devs do this all the time—now it's Python."

---

### Step 3: Visual Polish (`app_v3_styled.py`)
**Duration:** ~2–3 minutes

🎯 **What you'll demonstrate:**
- Conditional styling with inline HTML/CSS
- Component extraction (the `render_message()` function)
- WhatsApp-like chat bubbles with role-based colors

💬 **Talk point:**
> "Same React mental model—components, conditionals, styling. Different syntax."

## File Guide

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | **[USE THIS FOR LIVE CODING]** Starting point—simple chat, ready to evolve |
| `app_v1_basic.py` | Step 1 result—basic chat dashboard |
| `app_v2_timestamps.py` | Step 2 result—with timestamps and ordering |
| `app_v3_styled.py` | Step 3 result—with styled message bubbles |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **[FOR AI ASSISTANCE]** Project context for Claude Code pair-programming |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.streamlit/config.toml` | Streamlit theme and layout settings |

## Live Coding Tips

### If something breaks:
1. Check the error message in the terminal
2. Switch to a backup version (`app_v1_basic.py`, etc.)
3. Ask Claude Code to fix it—it has `CLAUDE.md` context already

### Using Claude Code for Live Assistance

During the talk, just ask me (Claude Code) directly:
- *"Add timestamps to app.py"*
- *"Make the messages display newest-first"*
- *"Fix this error..."*

I'm configured with `CLAUDE.md` project context, so I'll generate code aligned with your talk's React→Python theme automatically.

## React → Python Mental Model Map

| Concept | React | Python (Streamlit) |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Thinking** | JSX, components, composition | Functions, state objects |
| **State** | `useState()` | `st.session_state` |
| **Rendering** | Component tree re-renders | `st.rerun()` script re-runs |
| **Props** | Object passed to components | Function params, session state |
| **Effects** | `useEffect()` hooks | Implicit (Streamlit runs top-to-bottom) |
| **Styling** | CSS classes, styled-components | Markdown, HTML with `unsafe_allow_html` |

## Timing Breakdown (5–10 min demo)

- **Intro (30–60s):** Show `app.py`, explain the React mental model
- **Step 1 (2–3 min):** Modify app.py or show `app_v1_basic.py`
- **Step 2 (2–3 min):** Show `app_v2_timestamps.py` or live-add timestamps
- **Step 3 (2–3 min):** Show `app_v3_styled.py` with bubbles
- **Wrap-up (30s):** Q&A / Takeaways

---

## Takeaways

🧠 **Think in JS** — Declarative, composable, async-aware
🐍 **Code in Python** — Practical, ecosystem-rich, fast to ship
🤖 **Bridge with AI** — Syntax compiler, pattern translator

> "AI doesn't make us code less — it lets us _think louder_."
